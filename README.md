# sevenSegmentDisplay
My Java implementation of the 7 Segment Display using multidimensional arrays.
A seven-segment display is a form of electronic display device for displaying decimal numerals that is an alternative to the more complex dot matrix displays. 
Seven-segment displays are widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, basic calculators, and other electronic devices that display numerical information.
